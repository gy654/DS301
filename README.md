# DS-301 Neural Style Tranfer
--

## description of the project
The goal of this project is to transfer the artistic style and appearance of famous paintings to photographs taken near the NYU campus. The combination of the two will be a creative generation assimilating the artistic painting in texture while preserving the content of the original photograph. To maximize the quality and artistic style of the output image, we aim to compare the performance of neural networks using content extractors of different architectures such as vgg19, Alexnet, and resnet50.
